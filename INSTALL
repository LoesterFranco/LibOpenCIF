LibOpenCIF - INSTALL file
=========================

The  installation  of  the  LibOpenCIF library is no complex. Just follow these
steps and the library should be compiled and installed without problems.

The  library  was  designed  to need no special dependences to compile. So, you
just need to meet this points to be able to compile it:

- G++ (GCC) >= 4.8
- Linux kernel >= 3.0

If  you  comply  to  the dependences, the package should be able to be compiled
without problems.

First, configure the package. To do it, run in a terminal, as normal user:

   ./configure

Then,  if  there  is no problems with the configuration, you can try to compile
the  library.  To do it, in the same terminal, run this other command, also, as
normal user:

   make
   
If  there  is  no  problems  (any  compilation problem,  report  it to the main
developer,  Moises Chavez,  to moises.chavez.martinez@gmail.com), just run this
command as normal user:

   sudo make install
   
To uninstall the library (if you need to), just run this command as normal user
in the package:

   sudo make uninstall
   
And, thats all.
