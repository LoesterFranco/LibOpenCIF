LibOpenCIF - INSTALL file
=========================

The  installation  of  the  LibOpenCIF library is no complex. Just follow these
steps  and  the library should be compiled and installed without problems. This
instructions  only work for GNU/Linux and Apple macOS X systems. The library is
not intended to be installed in Microsoft Windows systems.

The  library  was  designed  to need no special dependences to compile. So, you
just need to meet this points to be able to compile it:

- G++ (GCC) >= 4.0
- CMake >= 2.6
- Linux kernel >= 3.0

If  you  comply  to  the dependences, the package should be able to be compiled
without problems.

First, configure the package. To do it, run in a terminal, as normal user:

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..

Then,  if  there  is no problems with the configuration, you can try to compile
the  library.  To do it, in the same terminal, run this other command, also, as
normal user:

   make
   
If  there is no problems (report any compilation problem to the main developer,
Moises  Chavez,  to moises.chavez.martinez@gmail.com), just run this command as
normal user:

   sudo make install
   
And, thats all.
